 * You create an objectFactor to return the object. This object has an abstractClass
 * that it extends from. Then the factor checks if the object exists.. if it exists
 * it returns an implementation of this abstractClass with real data.
 * If there is no object to be returned, it returns an implementation of abstractClass 
 * that is the nullObject - an object just to inform that there is no available data. 
 * 
 * Not sure if it worth the effort. I dont think so.
